# Destiny
NEW: SDestiny.py - an Lpro version which does not save to a text file

Update: Now you can access a version of Destiny Radio in Destiny.py as the function 'call'

Destiny Radio 1.1 (radioDestiny.py)

  uses dependency 'espeak'
  
  to install on Linux/MacOS type command: sudo apt install espeak
  
  to install on Termux type command: pkg install espeak
  
   - select Termux in Never Sleeping Apps<Background Usage Limits<Battery and check Background Processes on Developer Options in Android. Disabling Lockscreen for a maximum time and enabling Speech when screen is off also helps to keep the audio running smoothly. Hack: Playing audio on Spotify enables it to run /unhindered/.
  
  to run type command: python3 radioDestiny.py
